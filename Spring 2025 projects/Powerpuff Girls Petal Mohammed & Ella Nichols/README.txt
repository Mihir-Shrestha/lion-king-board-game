ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
Suit up -- you too can be a Powerpuff Girl! In this 3-player C++ board game, you'll pick
your favorite Powerpuff icon, train your traits, and race across the board to save Townsville. 
Choose your path, pick an advisor, and roll your way to victory. Only one can be the ultimate 
hero -- so bring the sugar, spice, and strategy!
